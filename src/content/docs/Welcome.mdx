Welcome to AppVision™, multi-protocol monitoring software.

This document is for the configuration managers of the AppVision™ software.

AppVision™ is a **PSIM** software designed to realize applications in the following areas:

- Centralized technical management
- Building Management
- Security - surveillance
- Process control (automation)
- Home automation
- etc.

The hypervision of an installation consists in reporting the evolution in real time of sensors to be able to follow the state of the installation thanks to graphs, history, curves, etc.

AppVision™ can also control an installation in sending commands to the supervised equipment.

List of key features:

- Alarm management: acknowledgement, instructions, reports, sorting, etc.
- Display of animated synoptics in real time
- Real-time event tracking
- Status tables
- Display of curves
- Archiving of time-stamped events
- Consultation of the history
- Timetables
- Calculation of statistics
- Remote control of the system
- Etc.

The equipment monitoring of an installation supposes that the PSIM can dialogue with this equipment. It is therefore essential to check that the communication protocol of the equipment is included in the list of protocols supported by the PSIM.

:::note
In the case of a communication protocol not supported by AppVision™, we provide an API allowing to develop the new protocol manager.
