Before installing the software, close all other applications running on the system.

- Run `SetupClient.exe` and the instructions in the `readme.txt` file
- The installation process is self-documented, follow the instructions of the installation program

Installing the client software creates shortcuts on the Windows desktop:

- _"AppVision configurator"_, the AppVision™ configuration tool, able to connect the server from a distinct workstation
- _"AppVision client"_, an AppVision™ client

#### "AppVision Client", an AppVision™ Client Directories

By default, AppVision™ uses the following directories on the server:

- `"C:\Program Files\AppVision 4\Bin"` or `$Bin` below in this documentation, contains the executable files
- `"C:\Program Files\AppVision 4\Documentations"`: AppVision™ documentation
- `"C:\Program Files\AppVision 4\Configurations"`: AppVision™ configurations. The current working configuration directory is called `$Config` below.
- `"C:\ProgramData\AppVision 4\LogFiles"`: log files
- `"Documents\AppVision"`: export files, printing, ...

:::note
When upgrading to version 4.6 or higher from a previous version, the old directories located in `"C:\Program Files (x86)\AppVision 4.0"` are kept.
:::


The `appclient.exe.config` file contains configuration settings for the AppVision™ client process, it is in the `C:\Program Files\AppVision 4\Bin` directory of each client workstation.

The settings are configured in the `<appSettings>` section, for example:

```
<appSettings>
    <add key="PortWebService" value="80" />
    <add key="IpWebService" value="192.168.0.100" />
</appSettings>
```

PortWebService, IpWebService, and HttpsWebService parameters: the Windows client can be configured to use a web service to receive events on a TCP port with the PortWebService parameter.

- 0: indicates the default port 80, or the server port if the client is on the server,
- -1: the web service is disabled on the client side, acquisition of events by polling,

If the client-side web service is enabled, the HttpsWebService parameter allows to use the HTTPS protocol to secure the communications.

In the case of a client with several network cards, it is possible to specify the IP address of the client used to communicate with the server with the parameter IpWebService.

By default, the web service is disabled.
