To update AppVision™ from a recent version, it is not necessary to uninstall the outdated version, it is necessary to execute the installation program of the current version of AppVision™ on the server and on each Windows client station. If the version leap is not minor, please see the application note _"Operation - Upgrade AppVision.pdf"_.

It is possible to automate the update of Windows client workstations, for this you need to activate the _Automatic update of client workstations_ option (see General options), in this case when launching the AppVision™ client there is a version check with the server and if necessary, the update is installed automatically from the server workstation.

:::note
An update keeps the project configurations and the added files in AppVision™ `$Bin` directory.
:::

The list of changes and patches included in the update are listed in the _Release Notes.pdf_ file.
